# Lecture 3 - R code in handouts
This document reproduced the code included in the slides of the third lecture of Network Analysis and Infograohics.

## Preparing the global enviroment
We first clean our global enviroment, so to remove objects that may have been leaft from previous sessions in R.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

## Variable analysis data: An example
Executing the function `data()` we can explore the sample of datasets available in R. `Orange` is of these datasets and it includes information about growth of trees in terms of their circumference. We can recall this dataset and plot `age` and `circumference` variable, to seek for evidence of the relationship between these two varible. This would be a simple variable analysis.
```{r}
data()
Orange
plot(Orange$age, Orange$circumference)
```


## Network analysis data: An example
The package `igraphdata` provides a few examples network data. One of this is the `UKfaculty` data on personal friendship in a UK faculty. We can load these data as well as the package `igraph`.
```{r}
library(igraphdata)
library(igraph)
data(UKfaculty)
UKfaculty
```

This will allow us to retrieve the adjacency matrix.
```{r}
A <- get.adjacency(UKfaculty, sparse = F)
A
```

With this comand we plot the network using the Kamada-Kaway layout
```{r}
ll <- layout_with_kk(UKfaculty)
plot(UKfaculty,
     layout = ll,
     vertex.size = 10,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.1)
```



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
PR <- read_csv("proj_org.csv") %>%
  separate_rows(Partners, 
                sep = ";")
PO <- table(PR$Project, 
            PR$Partners)
OO <- t(PO)%*%PO
PP <- PO%*%t(PO)
```



This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
